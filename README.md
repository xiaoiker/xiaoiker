### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
   Iâ€™m a Post-Doc researcher at **Stanford University**. Before that, I was a Machine learniang researcher and a PhD candidate at CMVS, university of Oulu, Finland. Currently, I am working on machine learning and its applications. My research interests includes affective computing (e.g., emotion classification and human behavior analysis), medical image analysis and especially, MRI/fMRI reconstruction and acceleration.
